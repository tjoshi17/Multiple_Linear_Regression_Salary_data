# Multiple_Linear_Regression_Salary_data
In this notebook, we'll build a multiple linear regression model to predict Salary using an appropriate predictor variable.

### Project Overview

This Multiple Linear Regression model is for predicting Salary of the employee based on using an appropriate predictor variable. We have divided the data into Train and Test dataset. Trained the model using Training data and then Evaluated the model using Test Dataset.

### Tasks

- Reading and Understanding the data.
- Treating null Values.
- Visualising the data.
- Data Preparation - Dummy Variables
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Building a Multiple Regression model
- Residual Analysis of the train data
- Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Model Evaluation

### Findings

- Salary of the employee is mainly dependent on Age of the employee and Years of Experience.

### Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels.api, SKLearn)
- Data cleaning & Analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression
